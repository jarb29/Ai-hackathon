# Web Audit Report Components

## Executive Intelligence Report Structure

### **Performance Metrics**

#### **Overall Score: 65 (Grade C)**

- Composite score based on Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse metrics, and resource optimization
- Grading scale: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (<60)

#### **Core Web Vitals**

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): 4.5s** - Time for main content to load (Good: <2.5s)
- **FID (First Input Delay): 350ms** - User interaction responsiveness (Good: <100ms)
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): 0.3** - Visual stability (Good: <0.1)

### **Security Assessment**

#### **Security Score: 45 (HIGH Risk)**

- Critical security vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
- Risk levels: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL

#### **Identified Vulnerabilities**

1. **Insecure Protocol (HIGH)** - HTTP instead of HTTPS
2. **Content Security Policy Missing (MEDIUM)** - XSS attack prevention
3. **HTTP Strict Transport Security Missing (MEDIUM)** - Connection security

### **Strategic Recommendations**

#### **Priority-Based Action Items**

- **HIGH Priority**: HTTPS implementation, LCP optimization
- **MEDIUM Priority**: CSP headers, HSTS configuration
- Categorized by business impact and implementation complexity

### **Executive Summary**

#### **Business Impact Analysis**

- Revenue risk assessment from performance/security issues
- User trust and engagement implications
- Competitive advantage considerations

#### **Key Risk Factors**

- Data interception vulnerability
- XSS attack exposure
- Man-in-the-middle attack potential

## AI-Powered Analysis Pipeline

### **Three-Phase OpenAI Architecture**

#### **Phase 1: Config-Filtered Tool Selection**
- **Configuration-driven**: Essential tools pre-defined in `config.py`
- **Limited tool set**: Only 9 essential browser automation tools available
- **OpenAI selection**: AI chooses from filtered tools, not all available tools
- **Tools include**: navigate_page, performance_start_trace, evaluate_script, take_screenshot

#### **Phase 2: Browser Automation Execution**
- **HTTP communication**: FastAPI → Node.js MCP service (port 3001)
- **Chrome DevTools**: Real browser data collection via headless Chrome
- **Multi-container**: Separate services for API and browser automation
- **Tool execution**: Selected tools run against target website

#### **Phase 3: Structured Analysis & Executive Summary**
- **Technical analysis**: OpenAI processes browser data into structured audit
- **Executive summary**: C-suite business impact assessment with ROI estimates
- **Dual-audience**: Technical recommendations + business intelligence
- **Pydantic validation**: Structured JSON output with strict schema compliance

### **Complete Request Flow**

```
1. FastAPI receives /audit request
   ↓
2. AuditService → LLMClient 
   ↓
3. LLMClient._get_essential_tools() → Filters tools using CONFIG
   ↓
4. OpenAI receives ONLY the pre-filtered essential tools from config
   ↓
5. OpenAI selects from the LIMITED set of essential tools
   ↓
6. LLMClient → HTTPMCPClient.call_tool() for selected tools
   ↓
7. HTTPMCPClient → HTTP POST to MCP service
   ↓
8. Results flow back through the chain
```

### **Tool Selection Flow**
```
Config defines tools → LLM gets filtered tools → OpenAI chooses from limited set → Browser execution
```

**Key Point**: Tools are **pre-filtered by configuration**, not freely chosen by OpenAI. This ensures consistent, reliable audits while leveraging AI intelligence for optimal tool selection.
